The following files were generated for 'life_rom' in directory 
C:\Xilinx\8.2i\project\flappy_bird\life\:

life_rom.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

life_rom.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

life_rom.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

life_rom.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

life_rom.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

life_rom_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

life_rom_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.


Please see the Xilinx CORE Generator online help for further details on
generated files and how to use them.
